# Data-Science
### Welcome to my data science projects! 
I've long been fascinated by the potential of big data and its power to make accurate predictions about everyday events. With a particular interest in sports analytics and market analysis, I'm building my background in machine learning and continuously expanding it through hands-on projects.

### Current Projects
#### House Price Prediction Model
My first project in this repository focuses on predicting house prices using various machine learning techniques. I'll be iterating on this model to improve its accuracy and exploring different features and algorithms to better understand how they impact prediction quality.

#### NFL Big Data Bowl (Upcoming)
Iâ€™m excited to participate in the NFL Data Bowl on Kaggle, where I'll apply and refine my skills in sports analytics. This project will involve player tracking data, aiming to uncover insights that could drive strategic decisions in football. The focus of this years competition is i 'pre-snap' play!
